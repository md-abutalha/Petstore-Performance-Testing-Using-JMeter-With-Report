# Petstore-Performance-Testing-Using-JMeter-With-Report

This repository contains the performance testing results for the [Petstore](https://petstore.octoperf.com/) website. The tests were conducted using Apache JMeter, focusing on evaluating API performance under various loads.

## Project Overview

The performance tests aimed to evaluate the following:
- Response Time
- Throughput
- Error Rate
- APDEX (Application Performance Index)
- Server's ability to handle concurrent requests

## JMeter Installation Guide

### Step 1: Download JMeter
You can download Apache JMeter from the official website: [JMeter Download](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi).

### Step 2: Installation
1. After downloading, extract the **.zip** file.
2. Navigate to the **bin** folder.
3. Run the **jmeter.bat** file (on Windows) or **jmeter.sh** file (on Unix/Linux) to start the JMeter GUI.

### Step 3: Verifying Installation
Open your terminal and run the following command to verify the JMeter installation:
```bash
jmeter -v
```
## Project Setup in JMeter
### Step 1: Creating a Test Plan
- Open JMeter.
- Create a Thread Group.
- Set the number of threads (users), ramp-up period, and loop count.
- Add HTTP Request Sampler to simulate API calls to the Petstore website.
- Configure the request with the correct API endpoint and parameters.

### Step 2: Running the Test
Once the test plan is configured, execute the performance test by clicking the start button in JMeter. You can also save the test plan for later execution using the command line.

## BlazeMeter for Cloud Testing
BlazeMeter is a browser extension that allows you to run JMeter performance tests directly from your browser. It simplifies the process by offering quick test execution without the need for complex setups. Using BlazeMeter, you can instantly capture and execute performance tests with ease.

### Step 1: Installing the BlazeMeter Extension
1. **Install the BlazeMeter Extension**: 
   - Download the **BlazeMeter** extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blazemeter-the-continuous/mbopgmdnpcbohhpnfglgohlbhfongabi).
   - Add the extension to your Chrome browser.
   - Once installed, the BlazeMeter icon will appear on your browser toolbar.

### Step 2: Running Tests with BlazeMeter
1. **Capture a Test**:
   - Click on the BlazeMeter extension icon in your browser.
   - Start recording your interactions with the website (in this case, the Petstore application).
   - Once youâ€™ve completed your actions, stop the recording.

2. **Run the Test**:
   - After stopping the recording, you can execute the performance test directly from the BlazeMeter extension.
   - The extension will simulate the load based on your recorded actions.

### Step 3: Viewing Results
- Once the test is executed, you can view a simple summary of the test results directly from the extension.
- BlazeMeter provides a basic overview of response times, throughput, and errors, giving you quick insights into the websiteâ€™s performance.

### Advantages of BlazeMeter Extension:
- **Quick and Easy**: The extension allows you to capture and run performance tests without needing a separate setup.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Get immediate test results right from your browser.
- **Simplified Testing**: Ideal for quick performance testing without complex configurations.

With BlazeMeterâ€™s browser extension, you can efficiently run performance tests and gather essential metrics for analyzing the website's performance, all within your browser.

## _Test Scenarios_
Server: https://petstore.octoperf.com/

1. 30 Concurrent Requests with 10 Loop Count
- Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~0.50
- Total API Requests: 630

2. 40 Concurrent Requests with 10 Loop Count
- Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~0.7
- Total API Requests: 840

3. 50 Concurrent Requests with 10 Loop Count
- Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~0.8
- Total API Requests: 1050

4. 70 Concurrent Requests with 10 Loop Count
- Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~1.2
- Total API Requests: 1470
- Errors: 6 connection timeouts, Error Rate: 0.41%

## Test Report Regeneration Command
You can regenerate the test reports using the following commands:
```bash
jmeter -n -t petstore_t50.jmx -l report\petstore_t50.jtl
jmeter -g report\petstore_t50.jtl -o report\petstore_t50.html
```

Repeat the same for other .jmx files like petstore_t110.jmx and petstore_t180.jmx to generate their respective reports.

## Results Summary
The performance tests indicate that the Petstore server can handle up to 55 concurrent API requests with almost zero errors. For 70 concurrent requests, a 0.41% error rate was observed due to connection timeouts.

## Key Takeaways
- Performance: The server handles up to 55 concurrent API calls with negligible errors.
- Optimization: Further improvements are needed for higher load scenarios (70+ requests).
- Scalability: The website scales up to moderate loads but requires optimization for peak traffic.
